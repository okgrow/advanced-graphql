Look at the README of the `/api` & `/ui` folders to get started!

We strive to use best practices in this repo, but we prioritize the learning experience where necessary. This usually just means a simplified file structure, but this app lacks some safety and security features, so please use your judgment when reusing this code. If you have any questions or concerns about specific code, please ask us; we love to talk about code quality.
